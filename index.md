title: "CryptPad Deployment"
---

The goal of this project is to deploy CryptPad as a private and secure collaboration platform for the Layer 8 Cybersecurity Club using Docker.

The aim is to deploy CryptPad on a safely configured Rocky Linux 9 VM with SELinux enforcing through our Incus collaboration space. This setup will provide members a dedicated place to work on documents, notes, and projects without relying on third-party services. The focus is on protecting user privacy, exercising strict security hygiene, and provide an effective collaboration for all future (CCDC/Layer-8) operations.

Currently, the priority is to ensure all chosen elements run smoothly in this self-contained environment. This approach improves system manageability and provides a reliable, secure foundation for ongoing CCDC operations.
